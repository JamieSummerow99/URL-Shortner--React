During this project, I gained practical experience in applying object-oriented programming concepts and asynchronous JavaScript techniques using TypeScript. I began by planning the architecture of the application, focusing on modularity and separation of concerns. This involved designing models for product data, services for API interaction, and utility modules for tax and discount calculations. One of the key challenges I faced was working with asynchronous data from the DummyJSON API. Ensuring that components didn’t try to use data before it was fetched led me to implement proper async/await patterns and centralized error handling. Type safety also presented some complexity, especially when integrating external data. I resolved this by carefully defining interfaces and using type guards where necessary to prevent runtime errors. A solution I’m particularly proud of was the way I structured the codebase. By isolating responsibilities ( services for API calls and models for data structures), I made the application scalable and easier to maintain. Additionally, implementing utility functions for reusable logic helped reduce code duplication. For future improvements, I’d like to expand the project with a front-end interface using a framework like React or Vue to make the product data more accessible visually. Adding testing with Jest and better error feedback for users are also priorities.

This project strengthened my understanding of TypeScript and modern JavaScript practices, and I’m confident it lays a solid foundation for more complex development work ahead!
